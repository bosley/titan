# V Titan

- Programming language or VM ? (Thinking latter)
- Platform to target code to. 
  
  - Scalable (Embedded / RTOS / Desktop)

Titan itsself should be considered more an idea. An abstract virtual machine that can be easily scaled to work on different hardware while providing a single underlying execution environment.
